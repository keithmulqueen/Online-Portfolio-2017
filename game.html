											as a single player experience. Join three seperate groups of adventurers, as they explore the planet found in the centre of the universe.
											This game was developed in C++ using SDL and the Visual Studio C++ library.
											<p> In this game, the player follows the stories of three adventurers going on an action packed adventure. Every path you take brings you closer to
											discovering what truly lies in the centre of this mysterious world. Each path has their own team, their own equipment and their own problems to overcome.
											Battle or befriend all the other beings that were also intelligent or powerful enough to reach the centre of the universe. This game has many fundamental
											RPG elements while also bringing forward some new and exciting ones.

											In this game, players are not aiming to clear the screen. Instead, they are aiming for specific note blocks to advance and the more virtuo blocks that remain on screen after all note blocks have been hit, the better the score. </p>
											The game also has an options menu which allows the player to choose ball speed, paddle speed and whether or not they want to play through the game with these new rules, or the Atari classic Breakouts rules.

					<td class="shrink">DESCRIPTION</td>
					<td class="expand">		For this project, I have decided to develop the framework for a game which incorporates 6 design patterns. The game I have developed is a text based adventure game where the enemies, locations and properties of the surroundings within the game are determined dynamically.
											<p> The plot of the game is based around a disaster happening within a zoo. The player is a young cub who needs to escape the zoo after an earthquake happens. Throughout the game, the player is met with many enemies which are dynamically decided at Runtime. 
											Each location that the player enters, there is a chance of meeting friends or uncovering his lost mother who he needs to find before escaping. Moments where the player can find his mother are again decided dynamically.</p>
											<p> In this project, I decided that the STATE design pattern would be very suitable when tackling how the player may need multiple state transitions when meeting new friends throughout the game. Originally the players current state is set to having no friends, and depending on what friend that player meets on the journey, 
											a different corresponding message should be displayed. In particular, if the player is only allowed to be accompanied by one friend at a time, I wanted the appopriate message to be displayed. Therefore, in my opinion the State design pattern was the only suitable design pattern for this operation.</p>
											<p> For this project, I was required to find a design pattern which allowed me to determine whether or not I had achieved certain goals in completing the game. The FACADE design pattern does checks and determines whether or not the player has checked through for multiple values before allowing the player to enter another section of code.
											In other words, for this project I required the player to not only reach the end goal, but if the player did not find his mother along his journey then he wouldnt be allowed to complete the game. Instead, the player would need to roam the area looking for the mother before being allowed to exit. 
											Below we can see that the game requires the mother to be Found and the distance goal to be reached.o use, and check methods are a good way of determining if all the players goals have been achieved. </p>
											<p> The very first design pattern that I implemented into my project was the FACTORY design pattern. This pattern allows me to dynamically create the appropriate object from a selection dynamically chosen at runtime. In my code, the player can be attacked by a number of enemies. But instead of the predetermined choosing of what enemy to create, we use a random generator to determine what enemy to create.
											The factory class, awaits for the execution of code that gives the factory the appropriate object to make. Whether its a lion object or a gorilla object, the program decides this at runtime.</p>
											<p> One of the more innovative parts of the game I have developed, is the memory recording feature. Using the MEMENTO design pattern I was able to dynamically save and record an objects state at different times during runtime. With these saved states, I was able to create an array List which held all these states and could be output to the user at any time. 
											I created a GUI screen to help implement this design. By selecting the previous and next buttons, the player could look over the memories recorded in the ArrayList. For further implementation of the game, we could hide secret codes throughout the game which could be later used by the player to access secret doorways etc.</p>
											<p> In my opinion, the DECORATOR design pattern was one of the easier design patterns for me to get a good grasp with. In this project, I decided that the decorator design pattern would be appropriate for giving values to different terrain locations. Firstly, I created a simple plain Undecorated Location class. 
											Then, I created multiple classes which would would together with the Location class to add different values and personality to the object. </p>
											I decided to use the ADAPTER design pattern in my program because it is very useful when dealing with additional external classes that are being incorporated into the code. In my program, I had enemies which were trying to attack in different ways, therefore the method names were different when they were being executed to do technically the same jobs. 
											For example, in my code a cobra has an attack method whereas a boa constrictor has a squeeze method. Both are used to inflict damage on the player and use the game input and return values.

										I completed the development of the game in a group of four, with all four of us being students from the University of Limerick.	As part of the group, I created all the games artwork and helped design the code.
										<p> The game itself is a remake of the Atari classic game Chopper Command. The story behind this remake, is that the chopper has been damaged and hitting the space bar keeps the chopper air-bound. The mechanics are similar to the now successful app Flappy Bird.</p>
										<p> There are multiple enemies in the game including enemy choppers, enemy jets, grounded trucks and parachuting guys. The chopper has a health bar on the top of the screen and the more enemies destroyed and the longer the player can survive, the higher the score that will be achieved.</p>
										The graphics for this game were simple yet very affective, there were multiple layers which had separate movements across the screen. The background image never moves and was a beautiful sunrise similar to the original Chopper Command title. The layers on the foreground of the game moved appropriately to represent the choppers high velocity movement. 
										<p> Visual techniques were applied to the chopper coordinates, to represent black smoke. </p>
										This project was one of the first full games I have been a part of, and although we competed against others who had been programming for a lot longer than all of us combined. We placed very well and were overall happy with the result.

										<p> The game can only be played with two local players playing on the same keyboard. The WASDF keys were used to control one of the Penguin characters, while the arrow keys and 0 character were used to control the other character.
										The players attempt to shoot each other with fish, until one of the players fall into the water. The winner is the player who avoids the water collision detection the longest. Originally I had hoped to implement a high score system, with time and 
										attacks landed being the variables to determine the score, however due to time restraints I had not been able to finish this.</p>
										The movement mechanics were designed to represent movement on ice, and that is why the characters did not come to complete halts when the players stopped pressing buttons. The games animation and graphics were designed using simple sprite alterations to represent movement when then
										the player hit the water. The main characters had 4 possible sprite forms through the game, these were the same sprite just rotated 90 degrees from each other depending on the last directional key pressed.

											The code will not execute further if an invalid input is given.</p>
											<p> When the user enters a valid date, then a new screen will pop up asking the user whether or not they are a member of the DoECL. If the user chooses yes, they are asked for verification before they can proceed. This includes a valid user name and password.
											However, if the user chooses no, they can continue with the process. </p>
											The final screen is used to gain the users personal and home information, including full name, address, estimated property value, property location and whether or not the user owns a private or public residence.	When the user selects okay, the program uses all the gathered information 
											to determine what the appropriate amount of tax due is. The results are then output on the screen and the information is stored in a CSV file.

					<td class="shrink">DESCRIPTION</td>
					<td class="expand">		For this project, I used Threading and OpenMP to create a serial implementation of Conway's Game of Life. This project was created using the C programming language and Visual Studio C++ professional 2013.
											The program is then run on the Windows DOS Command Prompt.
											<p>To begin running the code, first you need to enter two numerical command line arguments. The first being for the size of the NxN array. The second being for the number of generations to iterate through. In the code, the command omp_set_nested(1); is called to implement nested parallelism.</p>
											<p>If the user gives an incorrect number of arguments, an error message will pop up and suggest the user to enter new values as command line arguments. This is one of the concerns that my code had taken into consideration. I ensured all possible errors were handled when dealing with the users input.
											The inputs are converted to integers and used to create 2 identical arrays of size N. The input itself does not recognise itself as an integer value and therefore I needed to use the x = atoi(argv[1]) + 2 function.</p>
											<p>Memory blocks are allocated to these arrays and each value is initialised to 0 using the a = calloc(P, sizeof(int*)); function. This memory is then later removed using the free(a); function. Both of the arrays are checked for allocation issues, if the array value is 0 then an error message is called.
											An initial NxN array(neighbourhood) is created, with random values given for the cells. Each cell has a 50% chance of being initialised to 0(dead) or 1(alive). This initialised array is then displayed and printed on the screen. Where cells were active, 1 is printed to the screen and where cells are dead, 0 is printed to the screen.</p>
											<p>Once the initial neighbourhood is displayed on screen, we need to calculate how the array iterates over the given number of generations.Using the second command line argument that we took in earlier, we perform said amount of iterations of the following code. Here we can decide how many threads we would like to use in parallel when executing the neighbourhood. 
											Currently, i have set this value to 1. By using the #pragma omp parallel num_threads(1) function, we can adjust how many threads we require to gain the best performance. Calculations are then done to convert the existing neighbourhood into the new generation. The first array created is now used as an input array and the second array is used as an output array.
											The first of the two arrays we made earlier is used to hold the values of the first initial neighbourhood, however in this section of the code we will be using the second array, so again we will need to display the neighbourhood to the screen. </p>
											<p>The values for the new generation are created from the spec given; The cell becomes 0 if it has exactly 3 active neighbours, The cell dies if it has < 2 active neighbours, The cell dies if it has > 3 active neighbours.</p>
											To calculate the number of active neighbours, there is an activeNeighbourAmount(int **neighbourhood, int row, int col) function which is called. This function examines all the cells around the current cell being looked at, and counts how many of the neighbour cells are active. To maximise speed, the allocation of the new values through nested for loops for each cell are done in parallel.
											After displaying the values to the screen, the values of the second array are moved into the first array, and using the new first array values, the same code is executed through all chosen generations. For security reasons, there is a flag which is used. If the input and output arrays are the exact same value, this means that the grid will no longer change and be trapped in this state. 
											Therefore if this occurs, the for loop is broken. This is another concern that was considered in my code.

					<td class="shrink">DESCRIPTION</td>
					<td class="expand">		For this project, it was my first attempt at developing a game in any language as part of my course. The game was developed using Game Maker which uses simple drag and drop action sequences
											and the sandbox scripting language known as GML.
											<p> The game involves playing through three levels with the Piggy character. The player begins each level with a 0 score, and the score is increased by defeating an endless horde of enemies that continually re-spawn.
											The level is complete when the player collects all 5 coloured balls on the screen. The challenge of the game, is for the player to manage there life to the best of there abilities. To attack enemies and gain points,
											the player must jump on top of the enemies head. However, the movements of the chickens can be unpredictable, and the special white chicken cannot be removed from the screen. If any chicken successfully attacks the player
											then the game is over. The high score will only be saved if the player collects all the balls on screen. </p>
											<p> If the player is defeated, then the player can reset the level immediately from the pop up menu. The challenge of this game is to build up a high score without getting too greedy, because its very easy to make one bad move and
											lose all of the players progress.</p>
											The three levels include the Farm level, the Swimming pool level and the Mountain level and each level has unique features. In the farm level, the player can use a cow as a spring board to reach higher jumps. In the swimming pool level, the player
											must avoid falling into the water as it will put the player in more danger of being attacked by slowing the players motion. In the mountain level, the player must be cautious about falling boulders and the lava which will end the stage immediately.</p>
											In the development of this game, I have worked closely with 2D pixel art, 2D animation and the implementation of audio. Although this was my first attempt at making a video game, I feel like its a good demonstration of my innovation and artistic abilities.

											the hippo to land next to the female hippo on the screen, then SUCCESS.
											<p>At the beginning of each level, the player is given a few tools which can be used to direct, bounce and roll the hippo to where he needs to be. By selecting a position on the screen, the player will drop the current 
											tool in that position. When all the tools are placed on the screen, the hippo will be dropped from the sky into the game. 
											The drop position can be chosen by the player by dragging the hippo across the x axis of the screen before all tools have been placed. Use the tools to ensure that the hippo can land next to the female hippo. </p>
											<p>But of course its not so easy, the player must avoid landing on the female hippo as this will ruin his chances. Also be sure to avoid the watermelons on the way down, if the hippo gets close enough to eat the watermelons,
											then he will get larger and larger which will make it more difficult to have a smooth landing.</p>
											The player can play a serious of levels in the free downloadable game, in which he must try to impress a new hippo per screen. 
											The levels can also be played with a friend over a connection where multiple players can work together to pass the stage or compete against each other for the female hippo.

This is done by managing 12 areas of economic development; Education, Enterprise & Jobs, Food Quality,
											Healthcare, Morals and Ethics, Population, Personal Freedom, Safety and Well-being, Social Capital, Governance, Technology and Wealth.
											<p> To manage all these areas of development, buildings must be created and improved to help grow the world economically. As the world is being developed, the species inhabiting the world can also learn to evolve from primitive beings to cyber species. You can also invite species from
											less developed worlds to come live with the home species. The more developed your world is, the more species that can be invited to your world. Soon you will have a well developed world, with the finest hospitals, supermarkets and schools available that will get a lot of attention from other players around the world.</p>
											<p> The president is the leader of the home species, and with points gained from the development of the world, more customisation options will become available for designing the inhabitant species.</p>
											<p> Be warned, there are some downsides to the actions that you take in this game. Be sure not to neglect any of the inhabitant species as this may force them to fight against the home species. Some of the buildings that can be created may also have some negative effects on the economy, for instance; power plants may offer jobs and improve technology, but
											they will also have a negative impact on healthcare and food quality. The key is a balanced economy.</p>
											Watch as the population of your world grows, and even the population of your species grows as they spread outside of your world and into the hands of other players all over the world.
